<h3>I</h3>

<div class='poem'>
I wake, the Sun does scatter into Flight<br />
The Dreams of Happiness I have each Night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O bless&egrave;d Dreams&mdash;full of Domestic Bliss,</span><br />
Too soon alas! They're banished with the Light.<br />
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>



<h3>II</h3>

<div class='poem'>
I'm going to tell in just the Briefest way<br />
The cause of all my Anguish&mdash;if I may&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then one and all will know the Reason why</span><br />
My Mien is Solemn, and I am not Gay.<br />
</div>




<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>



<h3>III</h3>

<div class='poem'>
On Christmas day a good Friend did present<br />
My Wife a Book; no doubt with best intent.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The "Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam" 'twas.</span><br />
Little I dreamed the Woe of its Advent.<br />
</div>





<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>



<h3>IV</h3>

<div class='poem'>
After the rush of Holidays was o'er,<br />
And things had settled back in Place once more,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wife found the Time to revel in that Book,</span><br />
And told me how she loved its Ancient Lore.<br />
</div>





<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>




<h3>V</h3>

<div class='poem'>
She soon possessed the dreadful Omar Fad,<br />
Which other Husbands, I have learned, think Bad.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But unlike other Fads which now are Past,</span><br />
This has the power to make me very Mad.<br />
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>



<h3>VI</h3>

<div class='poem'>
The others which she tired of years before,&mdash;<br />
Collecting Vases, Fans, and Spoons galore,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did not affect the Comfort of our Home,</span><br />
Therefore there was no reason to be Sore.<br />
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>



<h3>VII</h3>

<div class='poem'>
But now each time I come back to the House<br />
I find what was my former loving Spouse<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So deep absorbed in Omar's Rubaiyat,</span><br />
She reads right on, and scarcely does Arouse.<br />
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>



<h3>VIII</h3>

<div class='poem'>
Or else I find her with her Pen in Hand,<br />
Grinding out Quatrains which mayhap are Grand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She tries to make me Listen: Rest assured</span><br />
That I obey Not any such Command.<br />
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>



<h3>IX</h3>

<div class='poem'>
Had I but known just what my Fate would be,<br />
Inside a Drawer to which I hold the Key,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That Book forever would have Disappeared</span><br />
And thereby would have gained some Peace for Me.<br />
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>



<h3>X</h3>

<div class='poem'>
But ah, the Irony of Fate&mdash;that's how<br />
"A Book of verses underneath the Bough"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is what I hear from Morn to Dewy Eve.</span><br />
A Wilderness <i>were</i> Paradise just Now.<br />
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>



<h3>XI</h3>

<div class='poem'>
Sometimes when I am very tired, and Plead<br />
To be amused, My Wife says, "I will read."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And this is what she tries to make me Hear,</span><br />
"With Earth's first Clay they did the Last man knead."<br />
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>



<h3>XII</h3>

<div class='poem'>
But don't imagine while Possessed of Wit,<br />
That I assent, and therefore Calmly sit.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I take my hat, and hasten from the House,</span><br />
And come not back till think she's through with It.<br />
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>



<h3>XIII</h3>

<div class='poem'>
I might have Prayed, and possibly thereby<br />
Have gained relief from Somewhere in the Sky.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But Wife says, Omar's reckoning proves it</span><br />
"As Impotently moves as You or I."<br />
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>



<h3>XIV</h3>

<div class='poem'>
At least that is the Doctrine he presents,<br />
Although to Me it is Devoid of Sense.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My unbelief in what he says does Make</span><br />
My Wife's Love for him only more Intense.<br />
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>



<h3>XV</h3>

<div class='poem'>
And thus it is&mdash;the Rubaiyat's her Creed.<br />
It is her Comfort in all sorts of Need.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I tear my hair&mdash;I storm&mdash;I swear, and yet,</span><br />
'Tis only to dear Omar she pays Heed.<br />
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>



<h3>XVI</h3>

<div class='poem'>
"Some for the Glories of this world; and some<br />
Sigh for the Prophet's Paradise to Come;"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The greatest Boon I ask for is, I may</span><br />
Supplant this Interloper as a Chum.<br />
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>



<h3>XVII</h3>

<div class='poem'>
Now all the Years that we have Wedded been,<br />
Not once had Demon Jealousy crept in<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until this Omar&mdash;dead eight Hundred Years,</span><br />
Did come and her Affection from me Win.<br />
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>



<h3>XVIII</h3>

<div class='poem'>
I feel chagrined to Think, at this late Date,<br />
A Man so long since Dead can alienate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fond Devotion that's been mine alone.</span><br />
No Wonder I cry out 'gainst such a Fate.<br />
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>



<h3>XIX</h3>

<div class='poem'>
"The Worldly Hope men set their Hearts upon<br />
Turns Ashes&mdash;or it prospers; and anon,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just so those happy Days of long ago</span><br />
Were Mine, for one sweet space of Time then gone.<br />
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>



<h3>XX</h3>

<div class='poem'>
The last few Months I eagerly frequent<br />
My Clubs; wherein I hear great Argument<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Regarding Wives, and how to manage them.</span><br />
But come no Wiser than when in I went.<br />
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>



<h3>XXI</h3>

<div class='poem'>
Strange, is it not? Of all the Husbands who<br />
Before me passed this Door of Trouble through<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not One has left a word of good Advice,</span><br />
Nor e'en suggested what is Best to do.<br />
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>



<h3>XXII</h3>

<div class='poem'>
My Friends can't help me, yet they laugh to Scorn<br />
My downcast looks, and at the way I Mourn.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They do not know the Anguish of my Soul,</span><br />
Bereft of Wife&mdash;unhappy&mdash;and forlorn.<br />
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>



<h3>XXIII</h3>

<div class='poem'>
But this I know, whether the one True Light<br />
Kindle to Love, or wrath consume me quite,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'd rather have my former Happiness,</span><br />
Than to Possess the Whole great World outright.<br />

<h3>XXIV</h3>

<div class='poem'>
I oft' attempt to show Wife where 'twill Lead.<br />
She gets her Book, and says I must take Heed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That&mdash;"The first Morning of Creation wrote</span><br />
What the last Dawn of reckoning shall Read."<br />
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>



<h3>XXV</h3>

<div class='poem'>
One day I queried would she please to Say<br />
How long, how long this Fad was apt to Stay?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She smiled and said, "My dear, don't fret about</span><br />
'Unborn To-Morrow and Dead Yesterday.'"<br />
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

When you can't help yourself a single Bit."<br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>



<h3>XXVII</h3>

<div class='poem'>
PREDESTINATION&mdash;full of Unbelief&mdash;<br />
Must I accept it, is there no Relief?<br />

And bows me to the very Earth with Grief.<br />

Ah, if I only could some way Conspire<br />
"To grasp the sorry Scheme of Things entire";<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How soon I'd shatter it to bits&mdash;and then</span><br />
Remould it nearer to my Heart's desire.<br />

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
